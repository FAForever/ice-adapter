# ❆ faf-ice-adapter ❆

An [ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment) adapter to proxy Forged Alliance network packets between players.

## JSONRPC Protocol
The `faf-ice-adapter` is controlled using a bi-directional [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) interface over TCP.
The internal server was tested against [bjsonrpc](https://github.com/deavid/bjsonrpc).
Note that all JSON messages are newline terminated.

### Methods (client ➠ faf-ice-adapter)

| Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quit | | "ok" | Gracefully shuts down the `faf-ice-adapter`. |
| hostGame | mapName (string) | "ok" | Tell the game to create the lobby and host game on Lobby-State. |
| joinGame | remotePlayerLogin (string), remotePlayerId (int) | "ok" | Tell the game to create the Lobby, create a PeerRelay and join the remote game. |
| connectToPeer | remotePlayerLogin (string), remotePlayerId (int)| "ok" | Create a PeerRelay and tell the game to connect to the remote peer. |
| disconnectFromPeer | remotePlayerId (int)| "ok" | Create a PeerRelay and tell the game to connect to the remote peer. |
| iceMsg | remotePlayerId (int), msg (object) | "ok" | Add the remote ICE message to the PeerRelay to establish a connection. |
| sendToGpgNet | header (string), chunks (array) | "ok" | Send an arbitrary message to the game. |
| status | | [status structure](#Status structure) | Polls the current status of the `faf-ice-adapter`. |

### Notifications (faf-ice-adapter ➠ client )
| Name | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| onConnectionStateChanged | "Connected"/"Disconnected" (string) | The game connected to the internal GPGNetServer. |
| onGpgNetMessageReceived | header (string), chunks (array) | The game sent a message to the `faf-ice-adapter` via the internal GPGNetServer. |
| onIceMsg | localPlayerId (int), remotePlayerId (int), msg (object) | The PeerRelays gathered a local ICE message for connecting to the remote player. This message must be forwarded to the remote peer and set using the `iceMsg` command. |
| onIceConnectionStateChanged | localPlayerId (int), remotePlayerId (int), state (string) | See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/iceConnectionState |
| onDatachannelOpen | localPlayerId (int), remotePlayerId (int) | Informs the client that ICE connectivity to the peer is established. |

## Example usage sequence

| Step | Player 1 "Alice" | Player 2 "Bob" |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Start the client |  |
| 2 | The client starts `faf-ice-adapter` and connects to the JSONRPC server |  |
| 3 | The client starts the game and makes it connect to the GPGNet server of the `faf-ice-adapter` using `/gpgnet 127.0.0.1:7237` commandline argument for `ForgedAlliance.exe` |  |
| 4 | The client sends `hostGame('monument_valley.v0001')`||
| 5 | The game should now wait in the lobby and the client receives a lot of `onGpgNetMessageReceived` notifications from `faf-ice-adapter`||
| 6 |  | Now Bob want to join Alices game, starts the client, the client starts `faf-ice-adapter` and the game like Alice did. |
| 7 | The client sends `connectToPeer('Bob', 2)` | The client sends `joinGame('Alice', 1)` |
| 8 | The client receives `onNeedSdp(1,2)` | The client receives `rpcNeedSdp(2,1)` |
| 9 | The game should connect to the internal PeerRelay, and shows that it's connecting to the peer. | The game should connect to the internal PeerRelay, and shows that it's connecting to the peer. |
| 10 | After some time the client receives `onSdpGathered(1,2,'asdf')` and must now transfer the SDP string to the peer. | After some time the client receives `onSdpGathered(2,1,'qwer')` and must now transfer the SDP string to the peer. |
| 11 | The client must set the transferred SDP for the peer using `setSdp(2, 'qwer')`. | The client must set the transferred SDP for the peer using `setSdp(1, 'asdf')`. |
| 12 | The client received multiple `onPeerStateChanged(...)` notifications which would finally show the `'Ready'` state, which should also let the game connect to the peer. | The client received multiple `onPeerStateChanged(...)` notifications which would finally show the `'Ready'` state, which should also let the game connect to the peer. |

## Building `faf-ice-adapter`
`faf-ice-adapter` is using [libnice](https://nice.freedesktop.org/wiki/), a glib-based [ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment) implementation.
`faf-ice-adapter` is intentionally single-threaded to keep things simple.
`faf-ice-adapter` uses mostly async I/O to keep things responsive.

To circumvent mixing of mainloops, the remaining networking part of `faf-ice-adapter` is also using gio, more precisely [glibmm/giomm](https://developer.gnome.org/glibmm/stable/), to keep C++ development simple.

All current dependencies are
- libnice for ICE
- jsoncpp for JSON
- boost for logging and program options (totally negotiable, since boost is not a lightweight dependency)
- giomm for network sockets

### Cross compile for Windows
The easy way I used to build the static Windows exe is the remarkable [MXE project](https://github.com/mxe/mxe). These build instructions should work on Linux:
```
git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git mxe
cd mxe
make MXE_TARGETS=i686-w64-mingw32.static MXE_PLUGIN_DIRS=plugins/gcc6 JOBS=8 -j4 libnice jsoncpp boost glibmm
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/FAForever/ice-adapter.git ice-adapter && cd ice-adapter
mkdir build && cd build
../../mxe/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32.static-cmake ..
make
```

### From Windows
The easiest way seems to be MSYS2, but it should also compile with MSVC.

## Building for Linux
Install libnice, jsoncpp, boost, giomm (may be part of glibmm) and cmake and compile.


# Testing
1. Install nodejs: https://nodejs.org
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run bundle`
4. Run `node dist/faf-ice-adapter.js --id 1 --login 2`
5. Download the TestClient: https://github.com/FAForever/ice-adapter/wiki/Testclient https://github.com/FAForever/ice-adapter/releases
6. Copy the TestClient to the `dist` folder
7. Start the TestClient
8. Press in the Testclient `Connect` at Server
9. Press in the Testclient `Start` at ICE adapter

You can start multiple TestClient's.
One client must host the game, the other Client's can then join the game.
